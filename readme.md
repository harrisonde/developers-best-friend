# Laravel Basics
A little bit of practice with Laravel to build awesome things.

##I should expect what?
Expect to experience the basic functions needed to build a site in the Laravel framework.

* Creating a new app
* Installing and using Composer packages
* Routing basics
* Views
* Deploying a Laravel app on a live server

##What is in this repository might I ask?
Well, yes - you absolutely should ask. This repository holds one Laravel app, Developerâ€™s Best Friend, which includes:
* Lorem Ipsum Generator
* Random User Generator

Loading the application will present a landing page with links to the aforementioned tools. Once on the desired tool, a form is presented to collect input with a number of options.

I hope you enjoy!

###Lorem Ipsum Generator
Creating placeholder text is super annoying. The Lorem Ipsum Generator will help get the job done, fast.

####How to use.
#####Basic
Get your lorem ipsum the good old fashion way and use our form. All you need to do is let us know the number of paragraphs of placeholder text you need - we do the rest.

#####API
Feel free to call our API on the fly and pull a few lines of lorem ipsum. Using AJAX is one way you can ask the generator for lorem ipsum.

    $.ajax({
        url: 'http://p3.harrisondestefano.com/text/2',
        dataType: 'json',
        error: function(textStatus, errorThrown, jqXHR ){ 
        alert('error pulling');				
    },
        type: "GET",
        success: function(json){
                alert(json);
        }
    }); 

###User Generator
reating fake users is time consuming - the User Generator will help.

####How to use.
#####Basic
Get your fake users the good old fashion way and use our form. All you need to do is let us know the number of user and we do the rest.

#####API
Feel free to call our API. We recommend AJAX to get the job done.
   
    $.ajax({
        url: 'http://p3.harrisondestefano.com/user/1,
        dataType: 'json',
        error: function(textStatus, errorThrown, jqXHR ){ 
        alert('error pulling');				
    },
        type: "GET",
        success: function(json){
                alert(json);
        }
    });

    
###Routes
It is always nice to under the URL structure of an application - expressive clean URLs! This application will use the following routs:

| Method  | Route | Description                  |
|-------- | ----- | ---------------------------- |
| GET     | /          | index						         |
| GET     | /text      | lore ipsum generator form           |
| GET     | /user      | user generator form                 |
| POST    | /text      | handel lore ipsum generation        |
| POST    | /text{num} | Generaten  X num paragraphs of ipsum|
| POST    | /user      | handle user generation              |
| POST    | /user{num} | generate X num of fake users        |
